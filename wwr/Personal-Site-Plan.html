            <h1>Reasons & questions</h1>
            <p>Why will people come to your site?
                a: people will come to my website becasue there are many resources that don't have everything. this website
                is meant to help those players and dungeon masters.<br>
                What questions will your visitors expect your site to answer for them?
                a: the site will also and eventually have the rules to the game it self that you would find in the Dungeons &
                Dragons Book (Dungeron Master Guide). this will also help give access to feats and spells from supplimental books
                that most people may not have. <br>
                What types of activities will visitors want to complete on your site?
                a: at first I want this website to be a guide for playing Dungeons and Dragons, but then I want it to where eventually
                Players and Dungeon Masters alike can use this website to be able to use this to keep character sheets and and information
                for the campaign.<br>
                What information is necessary to complete any actions your site offers?
                a:to get to the first goal is to have the player's handbook 1. eventually I can add more of the PDF's of other books
                That I have.<br>
                Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get this information or complete the actions?
                a: I plan on giving multiple things<br>
                1. access to the base information and supplimental information w/references<br>
                2. give users/visitors the ability to trust a website, and to a site that they can share to others<br>
                3. add additional things like homebrew/house rules that they could be interested in playing with.<br>

            <p>This page will be used specifically used as the central point for the Website
            this will also have a section for many other pages, but for now I want there to be specifically
            a race, spell, and class pages. the class page will be extra if I have time to build it.</p>

                to different spell lists in level order then alphabetical order. each spell will have a breif
                description of what the spell does, and who can cast it. eventually the user can click on the name
                of the spell and then see the full description of the spell and its game mechanic.</p>
