                    <p>Once you roll for your abilit stats, you are then able to start picking out a race and class. now there are many combinations to choose from, but certain combinations are recommended over others.
                    on this page, the kinds of races will be put in alphabetical order with a brief information that can be considered in portant (Ability score adjustments, size, and base movement speed).
                    Underneath the table, is all the information of the races. most of the racial traits have names, but I took some creative liberty to create names for the ones that don't have a catchy name.</p>
